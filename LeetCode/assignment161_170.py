"""Assignment 161. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. 
In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
    - Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    - Output: 2
    - Explaination: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:
    - Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
    - Output: 5
    - Explaination: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

"""Assignment 162. Maximum Gap

Given an integer array nums, return the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form. 
If the array contains less than two elements, return 0.
You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.

Example 1:
    - Input: nums = [3,6,9,1]
    - Output: 2
    - Explaination: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.

Example 2:
    - Input: nums = [10]
    - Output: 0
    - Explaination: The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.

"""Assignment 165. Compare Version Numbers

Given two version strings, version1 and version2, compare them. A version string consists of revisions separated by dots '.'. 
The value of the revision is its integer conversion ignoring leading zeros.

To compare version strings, compare their revision values in left-to-right order. 
If one of the version strings has fewer revisions, treat the missing revision values as 0.
Return the following:
    - If version1 < version2, return -1.
    - If version1 > version2, return 1.
    - Otherwise, Return 0 

Example 1:
    - Input: version1 = "1.2", version2 = "1.10"
    - Output: -1
    - Explaination: version1's second revision is "2" and version2's second revision is "10": 2 < 10, so version1 < version2.

Example 2:
    - Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
    - Output: 0
